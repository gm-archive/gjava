<h2>Actors</h2>
<p>Actors are entities in the game that do things. Most of the time they have a   sprite as a graphical representation so that you see them. They have behavior   because they can react to certain events. All things you see in the game (except   for the background) are Actors. (Or to be more precise, they are instances of   Actors.) The characters, the monsters, the balls, the walls, etc. are all   Actors. There might also be certain Actors that you don't see but which   control certain aspects of the game play. Without Actors there is no game! </p>
<p>Also realize the difference between Actors and instances. An Actor   describes a certain entity, e.g. a monster. There can be multiple instances of   this Actor in the game. When we talk about an instance we mean one particular   instance of the Actor. When we talk about an Actor we mean all the instances   of this Actor. </p>
<p>There are two ways to add an actor: <br />
1) Click the add actor button in the G-java toolbar<br />
  2) Right click a folder -&gt; Add -&gt; Other -&gt; G-Java files -&gt; Actor
