/*
 * $Log: Hexagon.java,v $
 * Revision 1.14  2007/10/30 08:08:37  irrisor
 * topic 6180: fix restoring of some geometry classes
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2007/09/21 15:45:27  nca
 * move to using clones instead of what should be immutable static values.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2007/03/05 15:11:30  nca
 * Issue:  improper winding corrected on Hexagon.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2006/06/21 20:32:50  nca
 * ISSUE MINOR:
 *
 * Lots of removal of warnings: casting and unnecessary if/else blocks.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2006/05/11 19:39:24  nca
 * ISSUE(S): 197, 191, MINOR
 *
 * Major additions, possible issues will be uncovered:
 *
 * 1. Added the Savable system, allowing extensible savings of jME Scenes.
 * 2. Changed GeomBatch to support RenderQueue (by making it a Spatial).
 * 3. Shapes added, cleaned up.
 * 4. Node.getChildren will now return null if no children have been added, this should be checked for.
 * 5. LightController enhancements.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2006/03/17 20:04:17  nca
 * Contribution from NCsoft.
 *
 * Initial framework of batching system. Batches are stored in geometry object and are responsible for displaying their own buffers. They can override states to allow for state changes within single meshes.
 *
 * Batches can also describe how they are to be rendered. Currently only TRIANGLES is supported.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2006/01/13 19:39:36  renanse
 * MINOR: Copyright information updated to 2006.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2005/12/10 05:28:46  renanse
 * Code from Mark to handle texture coords nicer.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2005/09/21 17:52:55  renanse
 * Added defaultColor - ability to set a single color per geometry object (used if colorBuffer == null)
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2005/09/15 17:13:42  renanse
 * Removed Geometry and Spatial object arrays, fixed resulting errors, cleaned up license comments and imports and fixed all tests.  Also removed widget and ui packages.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2004/09/14 21:52:21  mojomonkey
 * Clean Up:
 * 1. Added serialVersionUID to those classes that needed it.
 * 2. Formatted a significant number of classes.
 * Revision 1.3 2004/05/27 02:28:26 guurk Corrected shape
 * for height.
 * 
 * Revision 1.2 2004/05/27 02:06:31 guurk Added some CVS keyword replacements.
 *
