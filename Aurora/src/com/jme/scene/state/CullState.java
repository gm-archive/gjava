/**
 * <code>CullState</code> determins which side of a model will be visible when
 * it is rendered. By default, both sides are visible. Define front as the side
 * that traces its vertexes counter clockwise and back as the side that traces
 * its vertexes clockwise, a side (front or back) can be culled, or not shown
 * when the model is rendered. Instead, the side will be transparent.
 * <br>
 * Implementations of this class should take note of the flipped culling mode.
 * <br>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> Any object that is placed in the transparent queue with two
 * sided transparency will not use the cullstate that is attached to it. Instead,
 * using the cullstates necessary for rendering two sided transparency.
