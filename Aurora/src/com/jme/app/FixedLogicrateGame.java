/**
 * <code>FixedLogicrateGame</code> implements a main-loop designed to acheive
 * frame rate independence. The goal is to keep a consistent gameplay speed
 * regardless of the framerate acheived by the visuals. The game renders as fast
 * as the hardware permits, while running the game logic at a fixed rate. The
 * concept behind this is forcing every game logic tick to represent a fixed
 * amount of real-time. For example, if the logic is updated at a rate of 15
 * times per second, and we have a person moving at 30 pixels per second, each
 * update the person should move 2 pixels. <br>
 * To compensate for the non-constant frame rate, we smooth the visuals using
 * interpolation. So, if the scene is rendered twice without the game logic
 * being updated, we do not render the same thing twice. <br>
 * Using a fixed-timestep model has a number of benefits. Game logic is
 * simplified as there is no longer any need to add "*deltaTime" to acheive
 * frame rate independence. There is also a gain in efficiency: the logic can be
 * run at a lower frequency than the rendering, meaning that the logic may be
 * updated only once every second game - a net save in time. In addition,
 * because the exact same sequence of game logic code is executed every time,
 * the game becomes deterministic (that is to say, it will run the exact same
 * way every time). <br>
 * Further extension of this class could be used to integrate both a fixed logic
 * rate and a fixed frame rate.
