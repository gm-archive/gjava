/**
 * CollisionTreeManager is an automated system for handling the creation and
 * deletion of CollisionTrees. The manager maintains a cache map of currently
 * generated collision trees. The collision system itself requests a collision
 * tree from the manager via the <code>getCollisionTree</code> method. The 
 * cache is checked for the tree, and if it is available, sent to the caller. 
 * If the tree is not in the cache, and generateTrees is true, a new CollisionTree
 * is generated on the fly and sent to the caller. When a new tree is created, the
 * cache size is compared to the maxElements value. If the cache is larger than
 * maxElements, the cache is sent to the CollisionTreeController for cleaning. 
 * 
 * There are a number of settings that can be used to control how trees are 
 * generated. First, generateTrees denotes whethere the manager should be 
 * creating trees at all. This is set to true by default. doSort defines if
 * the CollisionTree triangle array should be sorted as it is built. This is 
 * false by default. Sorting is beneficial for model data that is not well
 * ordered spatially. This occurance is rare, and sorting slows creation time. 
 * It is, therefore, only to be used when model data requires it. maxTrisPerLeaf
 * defines the number of triangles a leaf node in the collision tree should maintain.
 * The larger number of triangles maintained in a leaf node, the smaller the tree,
 * but the larger the number of triangle checks during a collision. By default,
 * this value is set to 16. maxElements defines the maximum number of trees that
 * will be maintained before clean-up is required. A collision tree is defined 
 * for each batch that is being collided with. The user should determine the 
 * optimal number of trees to maintain (a memory/performance tradeoff), based 
 * on the number of batches, their population density and their triangle size.
 * By default, this value is set to 25. The type of trees that will be generated
 * is defined by the treeType value, where valid options are define in 
 * CollisionTree as AABB_TREE, OBB_TREE and SPHERE_TREE.
 * 
 * You can set the functionality of how trees are removed from the cache by
 * providing the manager with a CollisionTreeController implementation. By
 * default, the manager will use the UsageTreeController for removing trees, 
 * but any other CollisionTreeController is acceptable. 
 * 
 * You can create protected tree manually. These are collision trees that you
 * request the manager to create and not allow them to be removed by the 
 * CollisionTreeController.
