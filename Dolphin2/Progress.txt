|||||| Parser/code output:
Script.variable does not work (is it important?)
Multiple '.' variables don't work
parser error with "var;" statement
Parser: auto do +,/,-,*,== for doubles to other doubles

enter key event does not work!

==== variable issue
setting a variable to an instance of an object and using .x doesn't work
it need to be able to handle both gmresource and instance and setting built in variables
Plan: create wrapper for all with support for objectname

||||| General
the rotate function alters the image so it looks terrible (possible use afflinetransform)
When doing masks check functions like place_free as they use sprite.sprite_width and should use a mask width
