|||||| Parser/code output:
Script.variable does not work (is it important?)
Multiple '.' variables don't work after normal variables (arrays work tho)
Complex Instance (). variable don't work
parser error with "var;" statement
Parser: auto do +,/,-,*,== for doubles to other doubles

enter key event does not work!

||||| General
the rotate function alters the image so it looks terrible (possible use afflinetransform)
When doing masks check functions like place_free as they use sprite.sprite_width and should use a mask width
The bounding box needs to be angled for sprite and mask when the sprite is at an angle
Change code so that it doesn't modify the image when scaling, rotating etc (more efficient?)
