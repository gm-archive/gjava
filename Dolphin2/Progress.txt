|||||| Parser/code output:
Script.variable does not work (is it important?)
Complex Instance (). variable don't work (they parse now =)) but not valid output
parser error with "var;" statement
Parser: auto do +,/,-,*,== for doubles to other doubles

enter key event does not work!

||||| General
the rotate function alters the image so it looks terrible (possible use afflinetransform)
When doing masks check functions like place_free as they use sprite.sprite_width and should use a mask width
The bounding box needs to be angled for sprite and mask when the sprite is at an angle
Change code so that it doesn't modify the image when scaling, rotating etc (more efficient?)
globalvar statement doesn't work (actually changes variables so that they are global threwout whole game)
Use code from gtge game.java to check if focus for the gm setting (freeze the game when the form looses focus)
Fix and/or/xor statements it doesn't compile
Need to create JUnit tests for gml functions to make sure I don't break anything.
Need to fix up DolphinWriter so that it is easier to read and write (since new lgm system)

|||||| IDEAS
Possibly make local variables so that they don't use hash table (faster) (won't work due to arrays)
Make a collision vector so it doesn't go through actors without collision events
