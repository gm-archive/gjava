<h2>The Main Idea </h2>
<p>Before delving into the possibilities of <em>G-Java</em> it is good to get a   feeling for the global idea behind the program. Software created with <em>G-java</em> take place in one or more <em>rooms</em>. (Rooms are flat, not 3D, but   they can contain 3D-looking graphics.) In these rooms you place <em>actors</em>,   which you can define in the program. Typical actors are the walls, moving   balls, the main character, monsters, etc. Some actors, like walls, just sit   there and don&rsquo;t do anything. Other actors, like the main character, will move   around and react to input from the player (keyboard, mouse, and joystick) and to   each other. For example, when the main character meets a monster he might die.   Actors are the most important ingredients of software made with <em>G-Java</em>,   so let us talk a bit more about them.
</p>
<p>First of all, most actors need some image to make them visible on the   screen.  During the software, the image for a particular actor can   change. (So the character can look different when it walks to the left or to the   right.)</p>
<p>Certain things will happen to actors. Such happenings are called <em>events</em>. Actors can take certain <em>actions</em> when events happen. There   are a large number of different events that can take place and a large number of   different actions that you can let your actors take. For example, there is a <em>creation event</em> when the actor gets created. (To be more precise, when an   instance of an actor gets created; there can be multiple instances of the same   actor.) For example, when a ball actor gets created you can give it some   motion action so that it starts moving. When two actors meet, you get a <em>collision event</em>. In such a case you can make the ball stop or reverse   direction. You can also play a sound effect. To this end <em>G-Java</em> lets   you define <em>sounds</em>. When the player presses a key on the keyboard there is   a <em>keyboard event</em>, and the actor can take an appropriate action, like   moving in the direction indicated. We hope you get the idea. For each actor you   design, you can indicate actions for various events; in this way defining the   behavior of the actor. </p>
<p>Once you have defined your actors it is time to define the <em>rooms</em> in   which they will live. Rooms can be used for levels in your game or to check out   different places. There are actions to move from one room to another. Rooms,   first of all, have a <em>background</em>. This can be a simple color or an image.   Such background images can be created in <em>G-Java</em> or you can load them   from files. (The background can do a lot of things but for the time being, just   consider it as something that makes the rooms look nice.) Next, you can place   the actors in the room. You can place multiple instances of the same actor in   a room. So, for example, you need to define just one wall actor and can use it   at many places. Also you can have multiple instances of the same monster   actors, as long as they have the same behavior. </p>
<p>Now you are ready to run the game. The first room will be shown and actors   will come to life because of the actions in their creation events. They will   start reacting to each other due to actions in collision events and they can   react to the player using the actions in keyboard or mouse events. </p>
<p>So in summary, the following things (often called resources) play a crucial   role: </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>actors</em>: which are the true entities in the game </li>
  <li><em>rooms</em>: the places (levels) in which the actors live </li>
  <li><em>sounds</em>: these can be used in games, either as background music or as   effects </li>
  <li><em>images: can be used as backgrounds for rooms or to represent actors </em></li>
</ul>
There are actually a number of other types of resources: paths,   scripts, fonts, and time lines. These are important for more complicated software.   They   will be treated in the advanced chapters later in this document.
