<h2>Scripts</h2>
<p><em>G-java</em> has a built-in programming language. Once you become more   familiar with <em>G-java</em> and want to use it to its fullest extend, it is   advisable to start learning to use this language. There are two ways to use the   language. First of all you can create scripts. These are pieces of code to which   you give a name. They are shown in the resource tree and can be saved to a file   and loaded from a file. They can be used to form a library that extends the   possibilities of <em>G-java</em>. Alternatively, you can add a code action to   some event and type a piece of code there. Adding code actions works in exactly   the same way as adding scripts except for two differences. Code actions don't   have a name and cannot use arguments. For the rest you enter code in   exactly the same way as in scripts. So we further concentrate on scripts in this   chapter. </p>
<p>As stated before, a script is written with code in GJL (the built-in   programming language) and is meant to perform a particular task. Scripts can   takes input-variables called arguments (sometimes called parameters). To execute   a script from any event, you can use either the script action or you can use   code. In the Script-action you specify the script you want to execute, together   with the up to five arguments. If you use a script from within a piece of code   it is done the same way you call a GJ-function.  Scripts can return one value. This is often used to build   calculating methods (mathematical methods). The <strong>return</strong> keyword is used   for this. No code after the return keyword is executed! When a script returns a   value, you can also use it as a function when providing values in other actions. </p>
