<h2>Rooms</h2>
<p>Now that you have defined the Actors with their behavior in the form of events   and actions, it is time to create the rooms or levels in which the game takes   place. Any game will need at least one room. In these rooms we place instances   of the Actors. Once the game starts the first room is shown and the instances   in it come to life because of the actions in their creation events. </p>
<p>There are a large number of possibilities when creating rooms. Besides   setting a number of properties and adding the instances of the Actors you can   add backgrounds, define views, and add tiles. Most of these options are   discussed later. In this chapter we will only discuss some basic settings, the   addition of instances of Actors, and the setting of background images. </p>
<p>There are two ways to add a room: <br />
1) Click the add room button in the G-java toolbar<br />
2) Right click a folder -&gt; Add -&gt; Other -&gt; G-Java files -&gt; Room </p>
