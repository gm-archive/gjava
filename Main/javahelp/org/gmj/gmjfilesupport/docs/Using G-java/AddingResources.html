<h2>Adding resources</h2>
<p>To add images, sounds, fonts or any other resources all you have to do is drag the files and drop them onto the G-java treview into the correct folder, for example images MUST be places in the images folder! </p>
<p>It can also be noted that you can drag files out of the G-java treeview and put them into folders if you ever want to move files around this can be very useful.</p>
<p>If you want to add standard G-java files then use the toolbar, or right click a folder and select new -&gt; other -&gt; then click G-java files -&gt; from here you can select:</p>
<p>Room<br />
Actor<br />
Action</p>
<p>You can also use the toolbar to add images and sounds by browsing for the files instead of dropping them in the tree. </p>
